# BalloonTracker

This program receives packets from HAM radio broadcasts, looks for the specific trackers that were on our payload, and recorded the location (including altitude) as well as correcting the antenna azimuth and elevation using a COM port, so we would continue to receive packets.

I am not the original author of this project, I took over it from someone who was graduating and was unable to continue work with the Space Hardware Club. I honestly don't remember what changes I made to it since I took it over, but it's the project that was the reason I picked up C#.
